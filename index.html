<h1>Hello. Welcome to my beautiful website.</h1>
  <p>This website pretty much just shows projects and my portfolio.</p>
  <p>I currently am learning Python, although I know a little bit of HTML, (if its not clear enough, heh)</p>
  <p>I'll probably add some kind of template soon so it isnt just this plan, old text.</p>
